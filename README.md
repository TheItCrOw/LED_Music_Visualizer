Some screenshots from it in action:

I've made a quick Youtube video (1 min) to showcase the Visualizer in full action. See here:

## Quick overview

The Visualizer's hardware is built on top of an Arduino Uno, though I could have used an Arduino Nano, but that was out of stock for some reason.
The Arudino reads the voltage/frequency of an Aux cable, that is being plugged into the outside of the wooden box.

It then maps the voltage/frequency to the LED lamps which are attached to two black poles. The higher the input voltage/frequency, the "higher" the lamps are being turned on. There are 5 buttons: One for switching between animating the music and showing an idle rainbow animation and the other 4 for switching colors. We got Blue, Red, Green and purple.

I am no engineer and this project was build just for fun, so this Visualizer definitely has it flaws - mainly on the hardwire side of it I would say. But it makes up for a good looking music animation and will make any party more satisfying!
